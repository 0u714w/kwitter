Doug- Scrum Master
Jen- QA Tester

General Notes:
1. I'm going to start creating an outline on the project tab in the repo.
2. It'll look pretty general at first but as soon as we start digging into it oI'll be able to specify more.
3. Feel free to slack me to add/ edit any backlog items. I think he wanted to delineate tasks so I'll continue to be the one to manage them
