TODO: create skeleton of kwitter
Different React pages to render

1. Sign in page
2. sign up page
3. Once user signs up either render back to login page or auto login


Features:
(but lets hit the reqs first)

1.  Have an initial friend like Tom on Myspace

Notes:
I just signed up with twitter, did the prompt to sign up, We don't have a user base to pull from but it then asked for some basic topics I'm interested to help personalize and/or finding people to follow
